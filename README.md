### UI-Design

* Structure
** single page 
** site with 4 Sections: Logo and Settings, Quotes, Timer, Streakbar

* Colour scheme
** orange as highlighting color and white font colour
** pictures with grey "filter" to standardize the looking

* font
** "Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types."
