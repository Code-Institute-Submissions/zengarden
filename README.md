## UX

### Purpose
The purpose of this Web-App is to allow people to track their meditation habits and have reliable timer to take the desired time off. Meditation is an effective method to relieve stress and increase well being. In our busy and stressful everday life it is often hard to find time to sit still and just take a deep breath. Due to my own experiences of meditating everyday and using various timers i had the motivation to build something that i can use myself and enable others to get the chance to benefit from a daily meditation.
 
### Who?

The WebApp is targeted to users who now basic principles or practices of meditation and who are looking for a solution to track their meditation time and have a motivation to keep up the day-to-day sessions by tracking their streak.

### Why?

Even though it would be great to have unlimited time for meditation like a zen monk, everyday life has its demands and we can often only slice a couple of minutes out of the day. Therefore the timer helps to enjoy the meditation sitting without worrying about meditating too long or too short. Since phone timers often have awkward timer sounds that are not sensitive the use of compelling gong sounds start and end the session itself.

### What?

 The core functionaly of this WebApp is to provide an meditation timer. It allows the user to start a session, which is signaled by a gentle gong sound. Furthermore the user has the option to activate/deactive an ambient sound, choose the prefered meditation time (5, 10, 15, 20 Minutes) and a background image. Additionally the WebApp tracks the day-to-day interactions and allows the user to track his/her meditation streak.

## User Stories 

The following user stories where defined before the development:
* As a meditator i want to choose between longer and shorter sessions, so that i can adjust my practice to my liking.
* As a mediator i want to have a countdown button after starting the mediation, so that i have time to close my eyes and adjust my seating before the "real" practice starts.
* As a meditator i want to be able to start / stop the timer, so that i can react to interruptions.
* As a meditator i want to be informed when a session is done, so that i know when my time is up.
* As a meditator i want to be able to activate / deactivate whitenoise, so that i have the chance to focus on my meditation in noisy surroundings.
* As a mediator i want to keep track of my day-to-day practice, so i keep being motivated even on days where my energy is low.
* As a meditator i want to see inspiration quotes, so that my mind has something to ponder on during my day.
* As a meditator i want to have beautiful backgrounds, so that my mind is in a positive state.

## UI-Design

### Structure

The Web App is designed to be a single page application. It basically contains 4 different size sections. On top is the title bar which holds the Logo/Application Name and the Settings-Button. The section that follows provides space to display random Quotes from type.fit. The third section holds the core functionality of the app - the meditation timer. It displays a circle that gets filled as time progresses. Additionally the time is printed below the circle. The user has the option to interact with a single button which controls play, pause and reset. At the bottom of the page the Streakbar is being displayed. It contains of 7 squares which get exchanged for squares with a checkmark after a completed meditation.

### Colour scheme

The App backgrounds with a light greyfilter on top of it to reach a standardized look. Orange is used as a highlighting color and the font is white.


### Font

Roboto was used due to its "dual nature". On the one hand its clean and geometric and on the other hand it signals friendliness and openness, which is believed to also effect the user when seeing the font.

## Testing

### Automatated Testing

Jasmine used to set up tests. Some example test where written but should be extended more broadly in the future. Therefore i would make sense to refactor the existing functions to make them easier for testing.

## Deployment

### Deployment via Github Pages
* Log in to GitHub 
* Choose prefered GitHub Repository
* Navigate to Repository Settings
* Scroll to GitHub Pages Section
* Set Source from "None" to "Master Branch"

If you want to deploy the site to githubpages yourself, you will need to adjust the routes for the registration of the service worker and the according manifest.json. If you want to test the service worker on a local machine you also need to remove the /{repository name}/ from the scope. 

### Working with the Code

* Choose "Clone with HTTPs" & copy URL
* Open Terminal
* Change the current working directory to prefered location
* Type git clone and past copied URL
